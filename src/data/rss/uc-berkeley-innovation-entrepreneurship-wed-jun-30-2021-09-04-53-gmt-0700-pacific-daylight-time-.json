The Center was established to foster the creation of innovative and transformative life sciences companies for the betterment of society and the Berkeley campus life sciences community. LSEC is designed to complement and catalyze the many existing resources of Berkeley’s innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystem, not compete with them.\n\nUC Berkeley ranks second in the world at producing venture-funded startups, ahead of MIT, Harvard, and Penn, and a close second to Stanford. ([Pitchbook(link is external)(link is external)](https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/pitchbook-universities-2020)). Much of this success is due to Berkeley’s superpower resources in life sciences entrepreneurship. These include the [recently announced(link is external)(link is external)](https://news.berkeley.edu/2021/05/11/bakar-bioenginuity-hub-berkeleys-bold-new-home-for-innovation-entrepreneurship/) [Bakar BioEnginuity Hub(link is external)(link is external)](https://bioenginuityhub.berkeley.edu/) (BBH) and [Bakar Labs(link is external)(link is external)](https://bakarlabs.berkeley.edu/) opening on campus this fall, the preeminence of the [Innovative Genomics Institute(link is external)(link is external)](https://innovativegenomics.org/) (IGI) founded by Berkeley professor and Nobel laureate Jennifer Doudna, the [California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences(link is external)(link is external)](https://qb3.berkeley.edu/) (QB3), and the [Bio Track(link is external)(link is external)](https://skydeck.berkeley.edu/program/#bio-chip) at [Berkeley SkyDeck(link is external)(link is external)](https://skydeck.berkeley.edu/), which ranks in the top five for university startup accelerators. (For a comprehensive list, see [begin.berkeley.edu(link is external)(link is external)](http://begin.berkeley.edu/).)\n\nAnother campus resource is the groundbreaking [Robinson Life Science, Business, and Entrepreneurship(link is external)(link is external)(link is external)(link is external)(link is external)](https://haas.berkeley.edu/biology-business/) (LSBE) dual science and business degree program for undergraduates, which was enabled [by a generous gift(link is external)(link is external)(link is external)](https://light.berkeley.edu/o/investment-transforms-life-sciences-and-business-ecosystem/) from Berkeley alumni Mark and Stephanie Robinson. This gift, with additional support from alumnus and adjunct Professor David Kirn and his wife Kristin Ahlquist, also created the LSEC, which builds upon the student-supporting framework established by the dual-degree program. Mr. Robinson and Dr. Kirn have agreed to join the LSEC’s Board of Directors.",
