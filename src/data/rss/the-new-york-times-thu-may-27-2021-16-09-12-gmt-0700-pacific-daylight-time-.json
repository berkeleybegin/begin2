  "excerpt": "How much will someone be willing to pay for a few pages of quarter-century-old bureaucratic university paperwork that have been turned into a blockchain-encoded piece of digital art?\n\nThe University of California, Berkeley is about to find out.\n\nBerkeley will auction a digital art piece known as a nonfungible token, or NFT as early as June 2. The object being offered is based on a document called an invention and technology disclosure with an early description of a revolutionary approach to treating cancer developed by [James P. Allison](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/31/health/harnessing-the-immune-system-to-fight-cancer.html), then a professor at Berkeley. The advance, called immunotherapy, eventually led to the creation of Yervoy, a drug for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, and Dr. Allison [shared the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 2018](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/01/health/nobel-prize-medicine.html).\n\nA 24-hour auction of [the NFT of Dr. Allisonâ€™s invention disclosure](https://foundation.app/UCBerkeley/the-fourth-pillar-uc-berkeley-2021-41258) will take place using [Foundation](https://foundation.app/), an NFT auction marketplace that uses Ethereum, the cryptocurrency network of choice for NFT collectors.",
