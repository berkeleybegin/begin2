  "description": "Startup Law Initiative, an initiative of the University of California, offers free incorporation services to entrepreneurs. Founders will work with Berkeley Law students and attorneys from top Silicon Valley law firms to incorporate as a Delaware C-corporation*. We encourage anyone needing incorporation services to apply, but we typically select candidate companies in most need of our pro-bono services. Importantly, companies will be responsible for State filing and registration fees (which typically come out to ~$700 and will be incurred with whoever you choose to incorporate)."
