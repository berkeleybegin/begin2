As we all continue to adapt to work-from-home practices and remote instruction, we remain hopeful and inspired by our students’ flexibility and motivation to further their design skills and to expand the possibilities of Design Innovation.\\\n\\\nThe Showcase features synchronous and asynchronous student presentations and published project sites.
